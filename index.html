     <h4>Career change <span class="meta">2019-01-26</span></h4>  
     <p>I needed a career change, I worked as a Lab Technician for an eye wear company for years with no advancement. So I thought to myself I needed to finish school and learn other skills and to find a career with an advancement and while also keep advancing my skills. So I decided to get into Software Development and never looked back since, the first language I learned was Java which looked intimidating at first but once you start coding you're pretty much hooked... </p>   
     
    
    <h4>Coding <span class="meta">2019-01-25</span></h4>
    <p>Who knew coding can be so much fun? From applications to making your own web site. I never had any coding experience until I went to school, then everything changed. I started off learning Java, then VB.net and SQL. I knew learning those 3 languages wasn't enough, so I am currently teaching myself how to be a Web Developer using Javascript, HTML, CSS and PHP. With a lot of youtube and lectures videos from <a href="https://www.lynda.com/">lynda.com</a>, I was on my way. I always loved computers, from hardware to games but I never really thought about who made those awesome softwares?! </p>
    
                
    <h4>Introduction <span class="meta">2019-01-24</span></h4>

Likewise, youâ€™ll usually find a community or two where all the professionals immersed in the field turn to when they need to converse with like-minded professionals. </p>
